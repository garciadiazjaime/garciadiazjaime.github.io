![Web Development: Three Predictions for 2025](/assets/three-lessons-learned-2024/banner.png)

In my last post, I shared three things I learned during 2024. In this post, I’ll try to predict three things for 2025.

## 1. AI will keep expanding.

AI is already here, and every time I speak with a colleague, the consensus is that we’re all using some form of Generative AI: Copilot, GPT, Cursor, Codeium; these are the ones I’ve heard the most.

I haven’t heard much about AI being part of CI pipelines, but I think that will change this year. I’m sure AI will become more involved in code reviews, application deployment, and monitoring.

At the same time, AI brings challenges like data protection and bias. Can we trust AI providers not to sell our data? How can we be sure AI responses aren’t biased toward specific products? Will web development jobs shrink as AI tools help us accomplish more with "less"?

## 2. More Web3

I’m a fan of crypto, and I believe decentralized technologies are a great way to remove intermediaries. In 2025, we’ll keep seeing a lot of activity in the crypto space, and I’m sure more websites will incorporate Web3 into their ecosystems.

When it comes to cryptocurrencies, I don’t really get the logic behind their prices. I don’t think I’ll be paying for anything with crypto this year, but I do believe prices will keep growing, especially with things like Staking Rewards and Crypto ETFs.

And to add another layer, I’m confident that 2025 will bring more AI+Crypto projects. So far, most of the projects I’ve seen have focused on exchange trading, but I’m pretty sure AI+Crypto will be a buzzword we hear more often in 2025.

## 3. More platform users, fewer custom websites.

There are different kinds of websites, and one of the most common is the "corporate" or "profile" website. This is where a company usually has:

- Homepage
- About Us
- Services
- Contact Us

There are a few alternatives out there that let you create your "space" or "profile" without writing a single line of code. These platforms take care of hosting your website, and most of the time, they optimize the code for SEO and responsive design. They also offer shopping carts, and some even help with inventory management and the delivery process.

So, I think we’ll see more people sharing their profile or social media account rather than their custom website.

Most likely, I’ll be wrong on all fronts, but hey, I’d like to revisit this next year and have a good laugh about it. Alright, let’s go 2025.
