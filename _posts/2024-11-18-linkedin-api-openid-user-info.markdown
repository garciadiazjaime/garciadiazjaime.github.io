![React: LinkedIn Access Token in 10 Steps](/assets/linkedin-api-openid-user-info/banner.png)

I recently integrated with the LinkedIn API, and it turned out to be pretty straightforward. The task was to retrieve the user's email address from LinkedIn. To achieve this, I primarily used two endpoints:

- https://api.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization

- https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken

- [Codebase](https://github.com/garciadiazjaime/demo-reactjs/blob/main/app/linkedin-api-openid-user-info/page.tsx)

## Prerequisite

To get this working, youâ€™ll need a LinkedIn App, which is easy to set up via the LinkedIn Developer Portal. Once created, your app will provide:

- **Client ID**: A unique identifier for your app.
- **Client Secret**: Used for secure communication between your app and LinkedIn.

Additionally, you'll need to set up a **Redirect URL**. This is where LinkedIn sends the authorization code after the user approves your app

## How to Get a LinkedIn Access Token in 10 Steps

Two endpoints, right? But to make it all work, there are at least 10 steps involved. Take a look at the sequence diagram:

![LinkedIn Access Token Sequence Diagram](/assets/linkedin-api-openid-user-info/linkedIn-access-token-sequence-diagram.png)

### Step 1: User clicks the `Authorize` button.

![Step 1: Click Authorize](/assets/linkedin-api-openid-user-info/step-one.png)

### Step 2: The web application redirects the user to LinkedIn.

You need to redirect the user to:

```
https://api.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}&scope=profile%20email%20openid
```

Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `REDIRECT_URI` with your values defined in the developer portal.

### Step 3: LinkedIn asks the user to log in

### Step 4: LinkedIn asks the user to authorize the web application

### Step 5: LinkedIn sends the user to the `redirect URL`.

In my case, the final `redirect URL` looks like this:

```
https://demo.garciadiazjaime.com/linkedin-api-openid-user-info?code=AQSWHfrKRe6Zvr-fSccBQl2FfpxdkPxx6penQgLAFuNWVXviCb2qmtuCdy9czV-vZIqIczV-4UQNcKuRQk1qMgA3c13CdPpGHxdItcpqMuMmJsksxXYLOohcBF7jaAAqA6nKMq6pXsLH5-itSnyGdnWVIDc1v1ynAzckv-DCOn1gP6lkQf8aWu3CM5E79Zoh8PmHS3_eWT0LymNSM7U
```

Notice how the `code` query parameter is passed. This is important because it will be used in the next step when requesting the `access token`.

### Step 6: The web application passes the code to a Lambda function

The reason for using a Lambda function here is that the next step involves requesting an access token, which requires passing the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Since these credentials should remain secure, this step needs to be handled in a backend-like environment.

### Step 7: Lambda Function Requests an Access Token from LinkedIn

Take a look at the code:

```typescript
const { code } = JSON.parse(event.body);

const config = {
  grant_type: "authorization_code",
  code,
  client_id: LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret: LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET,
  redirect_uri: LINKEDIN_REDIRECT,
};

const response = await fetch(`https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
  },
  body: new URLSearchParams(config),
});
```

### Step 8. LinkedIn returns the token to the Lambda function

### Step 9. Lambda function returns the token to the web application

### Step 10. Web application receives the token

The LinkedIn response for the `oauth/v2/accessToken` endpoint typically looks like this:

```json
{
  access_token:"...access_token...",
  expires_in: 5183999,
  scope: "email,openid,profile",
  token_type: "Bearer",
  id_token:
    "eyJ6aXAiOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImQ5Mjk2NjhhLWJhYjEtNGM2OS05NTk4LTQzNzMxNDk3MjNmZiIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5saW5rZWRpbi5jb20vb2F1dGgiLCJhdWQiOiI4NmNtemNrN2k2dG5tOCIsImlhdCI6MTczMTg4MDM1MCwiZXhwIjoxNzMxODgzOTUwLCJzdWIiOiJlbTVqVXhDcEh4IiwibmFtZSI6IkphaW1lIEdhcmNpYSBEaWF6IiwiZ2l2ZW5fbmFtZSI6IkphaW1lIiwiZmFtaWx5X25hbWUiOiJHYXJjaWEgRGlheiIsInBpY3R1cmUiOiJodHRwczovL21lZGlhLmxpY2RuLmNvbS9kbXMvaW1hZ2UvdjIvQzU2MDNBUUhnYWc5TVNUUDNGQS9wcm9maWxlLWRpc3BsYXlwaG90by1zaHJpbmtfMTAwXzEwMC9wcm9maWxlLWRpc3BsYXlwaG90by1zaHJpbmtfMTAwXzEwMC8wLzE2NjA5MzcwNTQ2MTg_ZT0yMTQ3NDgzNjQ3JnY9YmV0YSZ0PXpuRWFMUS1vSVRYVl9LT3B5aFZGcDRfUHVLd0JabGx5VGRjNTc3ZDBoWXciLCJlbWFpbCI6ImdhcmNpYWRpYXpqYWltZUBnbWFpbC5jb20iLCJlbWFpbF92ZXJpZmllZCI6InRydWUiLCJsb2NhbGUiOiJlbl9VUyJ9...",
};
```

Notice how id_token is included in the response, and this is a JWT (JSON Web Token). If you decode it, you'll get something like this:

```javascript
import { jwtDecode } from "jwt-decode";

jwtDecode(jwt);
```

which among other things it outputs:

```json
{
  "email": "email@domain.com",
  "given_name": "name",
  ...
}
```

For my use case, the `email` field is exactly what I needed. Now that you have the `access token`, you can also use it to make requests to the LinkedIn REST API, like this:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(`https://api.linkedin.com/v2/userinfo`, {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: access_token,
  },
});

const user = await response.json();
```

It'll give you basically the same info as in the JWT token, but now that you have the `access token`, you can use it to access any of LinkedIn's other endpoints.

## Conclusion

Overall, integrating with LinkedIn's RESTful API was pretty straightforward. One thing to keep in mind is that the process is split between the client and server: the client handles redirecting the user to LinkedIn for authentication and authorization, while the server is responsible for interacting with LinkedIn's API and passing the `ClientId` and `ClientSecret` which should not be exposed in your client application.
